# Onyx
Onyx is a free, open source Hardcore Factions plugin. It uses Redis for faction and player data.

### Is it finished?
Nope. I wouldn't recommend using it until I've decided there's enough functionality and the bugs are all fixed.
It's not going to be very quick because I haven't even started making it "efficient" until everything is in.
